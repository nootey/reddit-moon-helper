17,Just bought another 5600 moons  Thanks for the discount panic sellers! 🍻
16,"Anyone buying anything other than BTC or ETH at the moment? I'm still allocating a small portion of my DCA amount towards a few alts, but heavily considering sticking to the top 2 for a while. Thoughts?"
15,"Ratio target update with 12/28 days ([data](https://i.imgur.com/yNyo14z.png)): **0.91±0.08**  For those new to this: I'm crawling the sub daily to estimate how much karma was earned and extrapolate this data to get the prediction with a 7-day-fit. The round is just 43% over, a lot can happen until the end! If we see a change in activity, that will also impact the ratio."
15,"Bitcoin itself is risky but dumb money in crypto is is always advocating **""buying the dip""** in shitcoins which keep losing value and slowly fading into irrelevance  6 years ago, /r/cryptocurrency was buying up **cheap alts**  - Buying up all these dirt cheap altcoins..  - My DNT bags are so filled  - Any suggestions for alts to pick up?  - Ark, OMG, LINK, WTC are all pretty cheap compared to their ath right now. But so are most coins so dyor  - Omg, neo, ubiq, vertcoin, komodo, stratis... take your pick  https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/75ayv6/this_is_me_watching_people_sell_alts_at_a_loss_to/  4 years ago,  /r/cryptocurrency picked out these projects as strongest to survive:  > IOTA, ICON, Vechain, Nano, NEO, BCH, DragonChain, Factom, Zilliqua...  https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/au3j49/only_the_strongest_will_survive_the_great_altcoin/  FACT is, 99% of crypto is a pump and dump scam market that will keep going down in price, volume, interest and marketcap rankings.  - From the **summer of the 2017 bullrun, 88 coins in the top 100 are out of the top 100.**  Most with little to no real volume and/or delisted      https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20170627/  - From **January 2018,  80 coins in the top 100 are out of the top 100.**  Most with little to no real volume and/or delisted      https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20180108/  - Only 2 coins from the top 25 from January 2018 are in profit (BTC, ETH)  - Only 6 coins out of 3,000+ coins from January 2018 are in profit (BTC, ETH, BNB, DOGE, LINK, AAVE)  - Only 1 coin from 2013 has outperformed BTC (Doge which wasn't doing shit for 6 years until Elon started tweeting about it)  Be careful of /r/cryptocurrency delusions of buying good tech, team is working hard, hodl, this is when you buy and you'll thank yourself in the next bull run.  Most of this sub has somehow managed to lose money through multiple bull runs."
15,"Need to dispose of 11K Reddit coins in the next few hours.  Giving away SNEKs to anyone and everyone that wants one, please let me know!"
14,"Tomorrow you wake up and BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF got approved, BTC is at $120000  What will you do next ?"

13,It’s still crazy that liking a comment is basically giving somebody 27 cents. And it costs nothing to do it. The rest of Reddit is sleeping on moons.
12,"They say crypto ruins lives, but it has brought my family closer.  We live in a one bedroom unit now."
12,Anyone been providing Moons LP for a while want to give their thoughts on how it performed? Glad you did it or would’ve been better off just holding moons?
12,2021: Okay I will turn this 1k$ into 5k$ real quick   2023: Okay one more bull run so I can get back my 1k
12,Anyone managed to onboard their friends or family into crypto using reddit nfts or RCPs? I have been causally mentioning it and getting some genuine interest that crypto is implemented on reddit
12,If you were to make a shitcoin what would you call it?
12,"Forget the tech, whats the best name of a coin? Just the name"
12,"Do people still talk about bitcoin and cryptocurrency here, or is this just the moons sub now?"
12,"1. Crypto exits crabbing mode. Looks like GET REKTEMBER.  2. FTX planning to liquidate holdings worth 3.4 Billion. SOL holders in trouble. 3. MOON’s drops below 0.30, BTC steady at 25K & ETH at 1560. ALL ALGO holders are in red. 4. 69th SNEK Awarded by me to the daily thread.  Notable Financial Dates Coming Up:  September 13: CPI Print. September 14: PPI, Retail Sales, and Unemployment claims. September 19, 20: FED Meeting. September Jobs Data: October 06."
11,How many moons would you need to spend to get your go-to meal at your favourite fast food chain 😋
11,"MOONs already recovered that little dip from distribution, that’s bullish as hell"

11,"What the hell, the .2x multiplier vote is winning"
11,"I just sold all my moons (5,000+). Had to pay for medical bills. Sorry guys I can’t ride with you no more :/  Edit: thanks for all the kind words, hopefully someday I can buy my way back in, or work my ratio back up!"
11,"Hope everyone’s happy with their Moons Payout  I received 1200+ Moons, which elevated my 0.143 KM to 0.192! 🆙   Remember: if Sensei can do it, so can you!"
11,When MOONs hit 45 cents i turned 25% of them to USDT.  I was able to use those 200$ as part of my uni laptop fund to finally buy one.  I live in a third world country and had to rely on some crypto dealer to cash them out for me. He takes 5$ per 100$ unfortunately. But it was fine.
11,How often do you check your portfolio?

10,"You are gifted $1000 , the catch? You can only spend it on alt coins, what do you buy and why?"
10,Is anyone else concerned about next weeks announcements for the IPO? Like is there a chance Reddit just scraps moons/donuts/bricks in favour of their new gold system?
10,"With 9 of 28 days of this round done, we are currently on track for a ratio of **0.85 ± 0.11** ([plot](https://i.imgur.com/LXUNpnn.png))  So seems very similar to last one for now, and also feels like that."
